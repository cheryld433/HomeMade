With stay at home orders in place, are you tired of the same old dinners, would you like to change it up a bit? That's where we come in, we've created an interactive webpage where you can choose a region of the world you would like to explore and we'll provide you with dinner recipes and drinks to complement your dinner and even some regional music to make staying at home a bit more enjoyable. 

Instructions: 

i. Begin by picking a region you would like to explore.
ii. Pick a recipe that looks good, click on the recipe to print it out if you like.
iii. If you would like a drink  recipe, put in the type of liquor you would prefer.
